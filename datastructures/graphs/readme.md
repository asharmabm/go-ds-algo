Graphs

Types of Graphs

Directed Graph: A graph where edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between nodes.(Sometimes can go both ways, but not always.)
Undirected Graph: A graph where edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship between nodes.
Ex: Facebook has Undirected Graph, Twitter has Directed Graph.

Unweighted Graph: A graph where edges do not have weights, indicating equal cost or distance between nodes. i.e Only nodes has values, edges do not.
Weighted Graph: A graph where edges have weights, indicating different costs or distances between nodes. i.e Edges has values, nodes also has values.

Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle, meaning there is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
Cyclic graphs are most common in Weighted Graphs, We can start and end at the same node, but we can also go to other nodes in between.

Acyclic Graph: A graph that does not contain any cycles, meaning there is no path that starts and ends at the same node.
